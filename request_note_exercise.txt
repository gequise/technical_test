An application hosted at http://immense-hollows-74271.herokuapp.com
 has just been deployed and you are required to generate a Test Suite using Selenium or a similar framework.
Known behavior (not a bug):
The application periodically restarts and the list of items could be reset to its initial setting.
Assignment
a.- create 5 functional test cases and automate them
1- Create an item
2- Edit another existing item
3- Delete the item created
4- Check max long in description
5- Check if exist in the list the item with text “C​ reators: Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer​”
NOTE: The suite should be compatible with mobile and desktop and document the steps to run it for each platform.
b.- report at least 3 bugs and write a test case for each bug report that should pass if the issue is fixed
The code should be submitted to a git repository and should include all the documentation and/or instructions necessary for running it.
You are allowed to choose the programming language and any open source tools you deem necessary.
It’s a plus: T​ he Test Suite should count with a docker-compose.yml file that will allow us to run the test scripts without the need of installing missing dependencies and independently from the OS being used by to execute the Suite.
Documentation should be written in a way that can be understood by a manual tester with intermediate technical skills.
